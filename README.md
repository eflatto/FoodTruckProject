# Technologies Used
Java and Eclipsed
# Lessons Learned
1. Understanding of how to use arrays in Java to store multiple objects.

2. The importance of using encapsulation to protect the internal state of the Foodtruck objects
by making the fields private and providing public getter and setter methods where needed to access the data.

3. A better understanding of how to iterate through an array of objects that have encapsulated data and how to manipulate that data in a loop.
